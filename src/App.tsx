    "In JavaScript, var is function-scoped and can be re-declared; let and const are block-scoped, with let allowing re-assigment and const preventing it. However, const objects can have their contents modified.",
    "JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language used to create dynamic content on websites such as interactive forms, animations, and real-time updates.",
    "String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt, Object (includes arrays, functions, dates, etc.)",
    `"==" compares values after type conversion (loose equality). "===" compares values and types (strict equality).`,
    "A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope, even after the outer function has returned.",
    "var: function-scoped, can be redeclared and updated, let: block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared, const: block-scoped, cannot be updated or redeclared (but objects/arrays can be mutated)",
    'NaN stands for "Not-a-Number". Itâ€™s a special value indicating an invalid number result (e.g., 0 / 0 or parseInt("abc")).',
    "Template literals use backticks (`) and allow embedded expressions using ${}.",
    'undefined: a variable has been declared but not assigned a value. Null: explicitly assigned to represent "no value".',
    `let person = {
      name: "Alice",
      age: 25
    };`,
    `Using .push() method: let arr = [1, 2];  
    arr.push(3); // [1, 2, 3]  `,
    "A shorthand syntax for writing functions: const add = (a, b) => a + b;",
    `In a method: refers to the object
    In a function: refers to global object (window in browser), or undefined in strict mode
    In arrow functions: lexically inherited from surrounding scope`,
    "Event bubbling is the process where an event starts from the target element and bubbles up to its ancestors.",
    "Use event.stopPropagation() inside the event handler.",
    `map() returns a new array with transformed elements.
    forEach() just iterates without returning a new array.`,
    "A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.",
    `async marks a function as asynchronous.
    await pauses the execution until the Promise is resolved. Example: async function fetchData() {
      let data = await fetch("url");
    }`,
    `Using try...catch blocks: try {
      // code that may throw an error
    } catch (error) {

    "Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope before code execution."
